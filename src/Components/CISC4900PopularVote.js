            <strong>PopularVote</strong> is a live, room-based Q&amp;A tool for group sessions -
            classrooms, town halls, meetings. A host opens a session and gets a 6-character
            room code; participants join with that code and submit anonymous questions.<br /><br />
            The backend is a single <strong>Flask</strong> application doing three jobs at once:
            a REST API, a <strong>Flask-SocketIO</strong> WebSocket server for real-time push, and a
            thin AI orchestration layer that talks to <strong>Gemini</strong> to cluster
            semantically similar questions into themes the host can answer at once.<br /><br />
            <strong>Supabase</strong> (Postgres) is the source of truth; an in-memory dictionary
            in <code>SessionManager</code> is a write-through cache in front of it, rebuilt on
            boot via <code>hydrate()</code> so a mid-flight session survives a redeploy.
